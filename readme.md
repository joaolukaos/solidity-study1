# Solidity study
## _Learning test using MOCHA!_


Here I wrote a basic smart contract just to learn how I test things using MOCHA

- Learning to write a compiler in JS
- Learning how a package.json works


## TO DO!!!

- Update the smart contract to the 0.8.x Solidity version;
- Delete the "Car" class in inbox.test.js file (I've created this class to test the compiler );
